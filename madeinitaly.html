    <p>IBohemian London artist Robert returns to Italy with his estranged son, 
          Jack, to make a quick sale of the house they inherited from his late wife.
           Neither expects to find the once-beautiful villa in such a state of disrepair.
            Renovations go badly, with father and son soon finding themselves at odds. Robert’s 
            comical lack of DIY experience leads him to seek help from some colourful locals,
             including the no-nonsense Kate, an ex-pat making her living selling villas, who 
             quickly captures his attention. For Jack, the state of the house seems to 
             mirror his search for memories of happier times with his mother. 
             He soon falls for Natalia, a vivacious young Italian chef, who restores 
             both body and soul with delights from her local trattoria, until the pair 
             finds their developing relationship in jeopardy from Natalia’s jealous and 
             threatening ex-husband. As Robert and Jack painstakingly restore the villa 
             to its previous glory, they also start to mend their relationship. 
             The future may now look quite different and surprise them both.</p>
